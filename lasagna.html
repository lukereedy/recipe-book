<h1>Delicious Lasagna</h1>
<p>A cheesy delicious lasagna dish made from some of the freshest ingredients. A concoction of flavors your family is sure to love. Enjoy italian nostalgia in every bite</p>
<h1>How To Make It</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Spoon meat sauce on the bottom of a lightly greased casserole dish. Add 4 boiled lasagna noodles (or use no-boil or fresh noodles). Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. Add 1.5 cups of meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Repeat the same layers two more times.</li>
    <li>Top with mozzarella cheese. Cover and bake at 375° for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes. Broil at the end if desired. Let it rest for 15 minutes prior to serving with Garlic Bread With Cheese.</li>
    
</ol>
  <h1>How Many Layers Does A Lasagna Have?</h1>
  <p>Lasagna needs to have at least 3 layers in order to constitute a true lasagna. Most recipes have 3 or 4 layers.</p>
  <p>I opted for 3 layers of 4 lasagna noodles as that is what will fit in a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Additional layers would require a deeper baking dish. </p>
  <h1>Make Ahead Method</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Assemble as outlined but do not bake. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
    <li>Thaw frozen lasagna completely before baking.</li>
    <li>Let chilled lasagna sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to baking. Add an additional 10 minutes to covered baking time.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Reheating Lasagna </h1>
  <p>To reheat leftover lasagna: Place it in a lightly greased, covered casserole dish. Bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes.</p>

<h1>TIPS: For Enhanced Quality</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Flavor Enhancers: The hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce are flavor enhancers and can’t be tasted outright. The hot sauce won’t make it hot/spicy. I use Frank’s Hot Sauce.</li>
    <li>Marinara Sauce: I recommend using Rao’s marinara sauce for this recipe, it’s very high quality, lasagna is a labor of love that deserves quality ingredients.</li>
    <li>Cheese: Shred and grate the cheese from a block, avoid using packaged shredded/grated cheese for this recipe. Low moisture, whole milk mozzarella cheese melts the best. I use Dragone mozzarella, Belgioioso Parmesan, and Galbani Whole Milk Ricotta.</li>
    <li>Lasagna Noodles: No-boil lasagna noodles or fresh lasagna noodles can also be used for this recipe, neither of which need to be cooked first. Fresh lasagna noodles can be found in the deli section of the grocery store.</li>
    <li>Casserole Dish: If your lasagna is very close to the top of your casserole dish, place a baking sheet underneath the casserole dish to catch any splatters of sauce, as it gets hot and bubbly toward the end. A Deep Casserole Dish is helpful.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Storage</h1>
<p>Store in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Leftovers do freeze well. </p>
