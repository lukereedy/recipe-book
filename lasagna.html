       <div> <h1>How To Make Lasagna</h1>
            <p class="ps">Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.

        Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna, which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>The Secret Behind This Classic Recipe</h1>
        <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.

        There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, such as adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p>
