<h1>Crunchy Tacos</h1>
<p>Who doesnt like tacos? From their crispy shells to the right arrangement of spices in every bite. A taste of mexico right in the comfort of your home</p>

<h1>How To Prepare</h1>
<ol>
<li>Line 8-10 taco shells in a casserole dish and bake at 400° for 5 minutes. </li>
<li>Cook/crumble ground beef and diced onions until softened and cooked through. Drain grease and add taco seasoning, undrained diced tomatoes, and beef broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Stir in the cream cheese until melted and combined.</li>
 <li>Spoon rinsed/dried black beans in the bottom of each taco shell, then fill with ground beef mixture.</li>
 <li>Top with shredded cheese. Bake, uncovered, for 7-10 minutes. Remove from heat and add desired toppings. Serve!</li></ol>
 <h1>Make With Chicken (Optional)</h1>
 <
 <p>3 cups shredded chicken may also be used and seasoned/sautéed on the stovetop as outlined.
    I recommend that you cook the chicken over medium heat instead of medium-high, as it can become tough if rapidly cooked/boiled.</p>
    <h2>Additional Toppings</h2>
    <p>These baked tacos can be topped with salsa, sour cream, shredded lettuce, diced avocado or guacamole, diced onions, and chopped cilantro!</p>
    <h1>TIP: Keeping The Shell Crunchy</h1>
    <p> spoon black beans along the bottom of the taco shells to create a barrier between the meat mixture and the taco shell. (This works really well.)
        Refried Beans can be used in addition to or instead of black beans.</p>
        <h1>TIP 2: Storage</h1>
        <p>These are best if served immediately for a nice crunchy taco.
            If you do have leftovers, wrap each leftover taco shell with foil and store in the fridge. Bake in a 350° oven for about 8 minutes to reheat.</p>
