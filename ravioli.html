<h1>Ravioli dinner</h1>
<p>A classic, tasty italian dish is everything you would expect in a good ravioli. From well seasoned pasta to an explosion of goodness</p>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
   <li> Melt the butter in a large high-walled skillet and add minced garlic. Cook for 2 minutes. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 more minutes. Add the tomato paste, onion powder, basil, oregano, and mustard powder. Stir to combine.</li>
  <li> Add the chicken broth in splashes, stirring continuously. Slowly stir in the half and half. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer.</li>
  <li>Stir in the softened cream cheese and drained diced tomatoes. (Optional, reserve some of the tomato juice in case you’d like to thin the sauce out at the end.) Cook the pasta according to package instructions, drain. Reduce heat to low and stir in the Parmesan cheese.</li>
  <li>Add the ravioli and use a silicone spatula to gently stir until combined. Garnish with Parsley and red pepper flakes and serve!</li>

</ol>
<h1>TIPS:For Enhanced Quality</h1>
<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>Freshly diced Roma tomatoes or regular diced tomatoes can be used instead of Rotel if preferred.</li>
    <li>A teaspoon of hot sauce makes a nice addition to the sauce and won’t make it too spicy.</li>
    <li>Optional additions include: Fresh spinach or fresh basil.</li>
    <li>I use Rana refrigerated 4-cheese Ravioli with this recipe.</li>
    <li>To soften the cream cheese quickly: Heat 2 cups of water in the microwave. Place 3 Tbsp. cream cheese in the microwave and close the door. Let it soften for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Grate the Parmesan cheese from a block, it will melt and taste much better than packaged grated cheese.</li>
    <li>20 oz. tortellini can be used in this recipe as well. (Or try my easy Tortellini Sauce recipe!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Storage</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Store in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>While you can freeze leftovers, ravioli doesn’t hold up quite as well after being frozen and reheated.</li>
